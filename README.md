# knightrider-scanner
A simple ncurses terminal application implementing the Knight Rider scanner, also known as a Larson scanner.

Run `make` to build the project and `./kr` to run the application.

The program does not take any arguments, but has rudimental keyboard controls:

    Arrow Key Up    increases the speed of the scanner, to a limit,
    Arrow Key Down  decreases the speed of the scanner, to a limit,
    Key "n"         cycles through individual modes of scanner animation,
    Key "h"         toggles a help message similar to this one,
    Any other Key   exits the application.
